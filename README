Java to C++ Translator
Version 1.0
(c) 2011 - Nabil Hassein, Thomas Huston, Mike Morreale, Marta Wilgan

To translate Java code, first ensure that you have the following files in a directory:
- translator.jar
- translate.sh
- java_lang/java_lang.cc
- java_lang/java_lang.h

From the directory in which you have translator.jar, run the following command in a terminal:
./translate.sh /path/to/JavaFile

The translate.sh script will attempt to compile and run the given Java file, then proceed to
compile and run the translated C++ files. You will see the output of the Java and C++ versions
in your terminal for comparison.
